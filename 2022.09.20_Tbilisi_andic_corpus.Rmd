# \color{colorwhite} Developing the corpus of Andi

## The Andi Language: a sociolinguistic background

- Andic < Avar-Andic < East Caucasian, glottocode [andi1255]
- spoken in several villages of the Botlikh district of Dagestan. 
- more than 20,000 speakers of Andi [@aglarov02; All-Russian National Census 2010]
- Andi speakers are trilingual in Andi, Avar and Russian
- Avar serves as a lingua franca and is taught in school [@dobrushina17]

## Andic data

- Written texts from grammar sketches, some with translation
- Field recordings from 1 trip to Rikvani, a few trips to Muni and Kwankhidatli, and several trips to Zilo
- Especially the Kwankhidatli dialect is endangered; only known record is a few short texts in [@tsertsvadze65]
\pause
- Recordings were made my different researchers, with different approaches to recording and processing
\pause
- We have approximately 8.27 hours of recordings
    - 7.77 hours is transcribed
    - 3 hours are aligned with sound
    - 17.35 minutes are fully glossed

## Problems

- Andi has several dialects and no cross-dialectal standard;
    - no full-fledged dictionary 
    - no full-fledged grammatical parser (though see a first attempt in [@buntyakova22])
- Our recorded data are heterogeneous 
    - different dialects
    - different conventions 
    - different file formats 
- Due to our limited knowledge of the Andi dialects, sometimes we do not know what the correct analysis of a given word form is.
 
## Solution

The material has to be converted to a singular format using `phonfieldwork` [@moroz20]. For the Andi dialectal corpus the pipeline is as follows: 

- we preprocess the annotation files, converting them to ELAN `.eaf` format [@wittenburg06], 
- align them with the sound
- gloss them manually or correct mistakes and ambiguities left by morphological parser
- publish online using the Tsakorpus platform [@arkhangelskiy19]
- repeat all previous steps
