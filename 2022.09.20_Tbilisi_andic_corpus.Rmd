## The Andi Language: a sociolinguistic background

< Avar-Andic < East Caucasian, glottocode [andi1255]

## Andic data

- How many hours do we have?
- How many is annotated?

## Problems

- Andi has several dialects and no cross-dialectal standard;
    - no full-fledged dictionary 
    - no full-fledged grammatical parser (though see a first attempt in [@buntyakova22])
- Our recorded data are heterogeneous 
    - different dialects
    - different conventions 
    - different file formats 
- Due to our limited knowledge of the Andi dialects, sometimes we do not know what the correct analysis of a given word form is.
 
## Solutions

The material has to be converted to a singular format using `phonfieldwork` [@moroz20]. For the Andi dialectal corpus the pipeline is as follows: 

- we preprocess the annotation files, converting them to ELAN `.eaf` format [@wittenburg06], 
- align them with the sound
- gloss them manually or correct mistakes and ambiguities left by morphological parser
- publish online using the Tsakorpus platform (Arkhangelskiy 2019)
- repeat all previous steps
